//TODO go through and tag all my singleton enums with this XD''

/**
 * An enum with a single member, which is basically used as a boilerplate container for that one member, since Java HAS TO HAVE classes/types!  XD
 * 
 * The member can be gotten through <code>{@link Class#getEnumConstants()}[0]</code>, but, I think, should be called simply "I" as a nice convention :>
