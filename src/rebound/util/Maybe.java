/**
 * null is used for Nothing here!
 * 
 * This is different from normal Nullable fields/parameters/returntypes because it can nested-ly encapsulate nulls/nothings!
 * 
 * Say you have a function like {@link Map#get(Object)} that could return null because that's just the value or because the key is absent from the map.
 * If it was typed to return Maybe<E> instead of (nullable) E, then you could have get() return null only when the key was absent, and an instance of this class (wrapping whatever the actual value in the map was, null or anything else) when the key's present in the map! :>
 * 
 * (In almost all JVM's it's only efficient when the function gets specialized and inlined, since most JVM's don't optimize the runtime form of types other than primitive boxing classes, unlike the GHC does for Haskell ^^'' )
